title: Start of a New Year
---

<div class="message">
    As is the tradition with the start of a new year, I'm laying out a few goals of what I hope to accomplish in 2016.
</div>

### The Goals

Keeping this very simple, below are the main goals I want to accomplish in 2016.

* Use Haskell in 90% of my code
* Read 12 fiction books
* Complete 12 open source projects

As is also the tradition with goals, I fully expect these to change before the
year is over. My hope is they will either be refined, or I will have met the
goals and be moving on to bigger things.

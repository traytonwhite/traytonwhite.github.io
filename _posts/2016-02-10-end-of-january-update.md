### One Month Down - Update on the Goals

One month down, and here's the update on these goals:

* Use Haskell in 90% of my code
  * Not quite to this point yet.
* Read 12 fiction books
  * Finished <em>The Old Man and the Sea</em>
* Complete 12 open source projects
  * Been contributing to a few different places, but no new projects started

Last year I started working through
<a href="https://www.haskellbook.com"><em>Haskell Programming from first principles</em></a> also known as the
"Haskell Book". I'm still working through it (just passed page 1,000!), so not
quite to the point of using Haskell for 90% of my code. My plan is to use the
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/turtle">Turtle</a> package to stitch together most of the typical command line jobs I use
Bash and Python for.

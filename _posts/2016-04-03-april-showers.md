### New Job and Other Minor Updates

A few weeks ago, I joined <a href="https://www.anyperk.com">AnyPerk</a> as a
data engineer! Changes are always exciting, and I think this move is a great
change. Unfortunately this kind of change usually takes a lot of focus away
from other projects. Ho hum.

I've tried to stay on top of some minor OS contributions here and there as I
experiment with different libraries. As far as Haskell is concerned: I'm
hoping to complete the Monads chapter of the
<a href="http://www.haskellbook.com">HaskellBook</a> this weekend! I should be
able to explain to everyone what burritos really are.

Fiction reading has been a bit behind, but I've been reading <em>REAMDE</em>
and enjoying it so far.

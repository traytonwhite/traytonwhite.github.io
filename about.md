Welcome! This is the personal page for Trayton White. I'm a data engineer focused on making it easier to use data.

Some things I've done to make that possible include:

* Project manager of data-focused initiatives spanning data migrations, new analyses, and data quality
* Integration of third-party data sources through screen-scraping, official API's, and ad-hoc requests
* Programming scripts to parse Excel files into different format CSV files
* Creating a browser-based bot to automate use of a data load tool with no available API
* Extensive research and use of third-party API's for data loading processes
* Bash scripting to retrieve files from SFTP sites, pre-process data, load into databases, and execute database stored procedures
* Database design and programming including creating stored procedures, defining table metadata, and optimizing through indexing, normalization, and tuning
